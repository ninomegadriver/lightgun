# Classic Arcade Lightgun Documentation & Implementation  

This project aims to provide technical documentation about the classic arcade lightgun, manufactured by many different companies. Furthermore, also provide a playable implementation of the hardware for use with emulators.  

An important note is that the lightgun is still an active product manufactured and available for order by SUZOHAPP. [You can order it here](https://na.suzohapp.com/products/optical_guns/96-2300-12).

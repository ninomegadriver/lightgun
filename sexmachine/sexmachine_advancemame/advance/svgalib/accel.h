/*
 * New accelerator interface sketch.
 * As of svgalib 1.23, this isn't used yet.
 *
 * The main goal is to define functions that can be used as part of
 * certain kinds of interesting graphical operations (not necessarily
 * interesting primitives on their own). Obvious useful primitives
 * in their own are FillBox, ScreenCopy, DrawHLineList (solid polygon),
 * DrawLine.
 *
 * An interesting purpose is the fast drawing of color bitmaps, both
 * straight and transparent (masked, certain color not written). For
 * masked bitmaps ("sprites"), there is a number of possible methods,
 * the availability of which depends on the chips. Caching in
 * non-visible video memory is often useful. One way is to use a
 * transparency color compare feature of a BITBLT chip, either
 * transferring the image from system memory or cached in video memory.
 * If transparency compare is not available, it may be possible to first
 * clear (zeroes) the mask in the destination area, and then use BITBLT
 * raster-operation to OR the image into the destination (this requires
 * the mask color to be 0). A higher level (library) interface should
 * control this kind of operation.

/*
 * Acceleration primitive description:
 *
 * FillBox      Simple solid fill of rectangle with a single color.
 * ScreenCopy   Screen-to-screen BLT (BitBlt), handles overlapping areas.
 * PutImage     Straight image transfer (PutImage). Advantage over
 *              framebuffer writes is mainly in alignment handling.
 * DrawLine     Draw general line ("zero-pixel wide").
 * SetFGColor   Set foreground color for some operations (FillBox, DrawLine,
 *              PutBitmap).
 * SetBGColor   Set background color for some operations (PutBitmap).
 * SetRasterOp  Set the raster operation for drawing operations that support
 *              raster ops as defined in ropOperations.
 * SetTransparency
 *              Set the transparency mode for some operations (enable/disable,
 *              and the transparency pixel value). Source pixels equal to
 *              the transparency color are not written. Operations supported
 *              are ScreenCopy and PutImage, subject to their flags being set
 *              in the transparencyOperations field.
 * PutBitmap    Color-expand a bit-wise (bit-per-pixel, each byte is 8 pixels)
 *              image to the screen with the foreground and background color.
 *              The lowest order bit of each byte is leftmost on the screen
 *              (contrary to the VGA tradition), irrespective of the bitmap
 *              bit order flag. Each scanline is aligned to a multiple of
 *              32-bits.
 *              If the transparency mode is enabled (irrespective of the
 *              transparency color), then bits that are zero in the bitmap
 *              are not written (the background color is not used).
 * ScreenCopyBitmap
 *              Color-expand bit-wise bitmap stored in video memory
 *              (may also support transparency).
 * DrawHLineList
 *              Draw a set of horizontal line segments from top to bottom
 *              in the foreground color.
 * SetMode      Set the acceleration mode, e.g. let blits go
 *              on in the background (program must not access video memory
 *              when blits can be running).
 * Sync         Wait for any background blits to finish.
 *
 * It is not the intention to have alternative non-accelerated routines
 * available for each possible operation (library functions should
 * take advantage of accelerator functions, rather than the accelerator
 * functions being primitives on their own right). If something like
 * bit-order reversal is required to implement an accelerated primitive,
 * it's still worthwhile if it's still much quicker than similar
 * unaccelerated functionality would be.
 *
 * Strategy for accelerator registers in accelerated functions:
 *      Foreground color, background color, raster operation and transparency
 *      compare setting are preserved, source and destination pitch is always
 *      set to screen pitch (may be temporarily changed and then restored).

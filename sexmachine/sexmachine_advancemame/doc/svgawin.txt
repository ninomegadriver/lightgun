            AdvanceCAB SVGAWIN Driver Installer For Windows 2000/XP
            =======================================================


1 SYNOPSIS
==========

svgawin [/l] [/u]


2 DESCRIPTION
=============

The `svgawin' utility installs and uninstalls the svgawin.sys
driver in Windows NT/2000/XP.

AdvanceMAME and AdvanceMENU work also without this driver, but
you lose the ability to set an arbitrary video mode.

If you install it, AdvanceMAME and AdvanceMENU automatically
try to use it before any other driver, unless you set a specific
driver with the `device_video' option in the configuration files.

You must run this installation utility as Administrator.


3 OPTIONS
=========

These are the command line options supported:

    /l
        Install and run the driver.

    /u
        Stop and uninstall the driver.


4 TROUBLESHOOTING
=================

The svgawin drivers are inherently unsafe because they should coexist
with the normal Windows drivers.

The most common problem is that the Windows driver sets the video
card in a state that the SVGAWIN driver cannot understand or
restore.

The only possible solution is to try to reduce the video hardware
acceleration at the minimum in
DisplayProperties/Settings/Advanced/Troubleshooting.

If you want a stable solution you must use the Linux or DOS
version of AdvanceMAME and AdvanceMENU.

Alternatively you can try to use two different video boards, one for
Windows and the other for the game display. Check the
`device_svgawin_skipboard' option to control which video board to use.


5 TECH
======

This driver is used to export at user level some reversed operations
generally available only at kernel level. Specifically you can:

* Access the PCI information.
* Use direct port io.
* Map and umap physical memory.
* Call specific IOCTL_VIDEO_* ioctl on the Windows VIDEO driver.

It doesn't contains any specific video board code. It only exports
these basic services.

The services interface is detailed in the advance/svgalib/svgawin/driver/svgacode.h
file.

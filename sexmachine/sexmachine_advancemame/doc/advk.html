Description
</h2>
The `advk' utility shows the set of keys pressed at any time.
It can be used for detecting the keys available for `advmame'
and `advmenu'. It can also be used for detecting the keys
that have the "ghost effect".
<p>
The utility prints the number of keys pressed in `[]' and the
list of key codes detected.
<p>
Check the `advdev.txt' file for the description of the
`device_keyboard' option.

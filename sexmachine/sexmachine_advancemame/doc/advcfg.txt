                    AdvanceMAME Automatic Video Configurator
                    ========================================


1 SYNOPSIS
==========

advcfg [-advmamec] [-advmessc] [-advmenuc]
	[-log] [-logsync] [-rc RCFILE] [-bit N]


2 DESCRIPTION
=============

The `advcfg' utility is the automatic video configuration
program for AdvanceMAME, AdvanceMESS and AdvanceMENU.

This utility works differently if one of the -advmamec,
-advmessc and -advmenuc option is specified.
The main difference is the name of the configuration
file used to store the video modes.

All the video modes used in the configuration process
have always negative horizontal and vertical sync polarity.

Check the `advdev.txt' file for more details on the video
drivers supported.


3 OPTIONS
=========

    -rc RCFILE
        Specify an alternate name of the configuration file.

    -log
        A very detailed log of operations is saved in
        a `.log' file. Very useful for debugging problems.

    -logsync
        Like the `-log' option but the log file is not
        buffered. This option must be used to get a complete
        log file in presence of a machine crash.

    -advmamec, -advmessc, -advmenuc
        Select the mode of operation for the programs
        `advmame', `advmess' and `advmenu'.
        The default is for `advmame'.

    -bit N
        Select the bit depth of the test video modes.
        If omitted 8 bit modes are used.
        Valid values are 8, 15, 16 and 32.


4 CONFIGURATION
===============

Depending one the command line options used one of the
`advmame.rc', `advmess.rc' and `advmenu.rc' file is used
to load and save the video configuration.

If the configuration process completes with success the
program adds these options in your configuration file:

    device_video_clock ?
    device_video_format ?

which define the capabilities of your monitor and video board.
And for the `advmame' and `advmess' modes also the options:

    display_mode auto
    display_adjust generate_yclock

which select the `automatic' video mode generation of the
emulators.

All these options are documented in the `advdev.txt'
and `advmame.txt' files.

Description
</h2>
The `svgawin' utility installs and uninstalls the svgawin.sys
driver in Windows NT/2000/XP.
<p>
AdvanceMAME and AdvanceMENU work also without this driver, but
you lose the ability to set an arbitrary video mode.
<p>
If you install it, AdvanceMAME and AdvanceMENU automatically
try to use it before any other driver, unless you set a specific
driver with the `device_video' option in the configuration files.
<p>
You must run this installation utility as Administrator.

Troubleshooting
</h2>
The svgawin drivers are inherently unsafe because they should coexist
with the normal Windows drivers.
<p>
The most common problem is that the Windows driver sets the video
card in a state that the SVGAWIN driver cannot understand or
restore.
<p>
The only possible solution is to try to reduce the video hardware
acceleration at the minimum in
DisplayProperties/Settings/Advanced/Troubleshooting.
<p>
If you want a stable solution you must use the Linux or DOS
version of AdvanceMAME and AdvanceMENU.
<p>
Alternatively you can try to use two different video boards, one for
Windows and the other for the game display. Check the
`device_svgawin_skipboard' option to control which video board to use.

Tech
</h2>
This driver is used to export at user level some reversed operations
generally available only at kernel level. Specifically you can:
<ul>
<li>
Access the PCI information.
</li>
<li>
Use direct port io.
</li>
<li>
Map and umap physical memory.
</li>
<li>
Call specific IOCTL_VIDEO_* ioctl on the Windows VIDEO driver.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It doesn't contains any specific video board code. It only exports
these basic services.
<p>
The services interface is detailed in the advance/svgalib/svgawin/driver/svgacode.h
file.

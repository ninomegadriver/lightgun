advk [-device_keyboard DEVICE] [-log] [-logsync]


2 DESCRIPTION
=============

The `advk' utility shows the set of keys pressed at any time.
It can be used for detecting the keys available for `advmame'
and `advmenu'. It can also be used for detecting the keys
that have the "ghost effect".

The utility prints the number of keys pressed in `[]' and the
list of key codes detected.

Check the `advdev.txt' file for the description of the
`device_keyboard' option.

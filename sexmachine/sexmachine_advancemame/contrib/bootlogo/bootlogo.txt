PURE DOS BOOT LOGO
------------------

by Robert Palmqvist aka EmuMannen

I didn't like to look at config.sys and autoexec.bat getting loaded in my
cabinet so I wrote two small programs. They are in the DOS device driver
format but they are not real device drivers and they do not stay resistant.
I made them that way just to be able to execute some code from config.sys
using the "DEVICE=" command ("INSTALL=" waits until all devices are loaded
and I wanted to execute my code before any other device driver loads). 

This is how my programs work:
BOOTMUTE.EXE is toggling int29h "fast console output" off first time called 
and on again next time called. It will hide the cursor and clear the screen
when turned off and show the cursor again when turned on.

All output to the console will be disabled if you put the following line
first in config.sys:
"DEVICE=BOOTMUTE.EXE"

Put the same line in config.sys or the following line in autoexec.bat:
"BOOTMUTE.EXE"
To enable screen writes again.

So bootmute is able to make all screen writes disagree during the boot up
sequence.

BOOTLOGO.EXE is checking if current graph mode is 13h. It will try to set
mode 13h and show the file "BOOTLOGO.PCX" if present if it is in mode 13h.
It will try to set mode 3 (text mode) if it is already in mode 13h.
BOOTLOGO.PCX must be a 320*200*256c pcx file in the current directory.

So I can put BOOTMUTE.EXE, BOOTLOGO.EXE and BOOTLOGO.PCX in the root of my
boot drive and put the following lines first in config.sys:
"DEVICE=BOOTMUTE.EXE"
"DEVICE=BOOTLOGO.EXE"

It will disable screen writes for all other programs, hide the cursor and
show the boot logo in mode 13h. I can then put the following lines just
before calling AdvanceMenu in autoexec.bat:

"BOOTLOGO.EXE"
"BOOTMUTE.EXE"

And it will turn screen writes on, show the cursor and reset to text mode.

/*
	spchroms.c - This is an emulator for "typical" speech ROMs from TI, as used by TI99/4(a).

	In order to support its speech processor, TI designed some ROMs with a 1-bit data bus
	and 4-bit address bus (multiplexed 5 times to provide a 18-bit address).
	A fairly complete description of such a ROM (tms6100) is found in the tms5220 datasheet.

	One notable thing is that the address is a byte address (*NOT* a bit address).

	This file is designed to be interfaced with the tms5220 core.
	Interfacing it with the tms5110 would make sense, too.

	CRT video emulation for TX-0 and PDP-1.


Theory of operation:

	What makes such CRT devices so odd is that there is no video processor, no
	scan logic, no refresh logic.  The beam position and intensity is
	controlled by the program completely: in order to draw an object, the
	program must direct the beam to each point of the object, and in order to
	refresh it, the program must redraw the object periodically.

	Since the refresh rates are highly variable (completely controlled by the
	program), I need to simulate CRT remanence: the intensity of each pixel on
	display decreases regularly.  In order to keep this efficient, I keep a
	list of non-black pixels, and only process these pixels on each refresh.
	In order to improve efficiency further, I keep a distinct list for each
	line of the display: I have found that it improves drawing speed slightly
	(probably because it improves the cache hit rate).

Short MSDOS utility to display IBM PC/XT/AT/PCjr. character set, by PeT

TO BE USED ONLY IN REAL DOS MODE!!!

The character generator ROM is not easily dumpable without an EPROM reader:
compile and run this program then make a snapshot of the resulting screens...

then mail the images to a MESSDEV member! ;)
